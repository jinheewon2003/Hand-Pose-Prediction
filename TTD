1. Try different 4 class model for slider to see which one it falls on (1 - 2 joint, 2 - 3 joint, 3 - 4 joint, off)
> Could gradually try increasing class number
> Make sure data encompasses all classes (ie make sure there is at least one data on end of both sides as well)
> Revisualize

> Consider distance to line distance instead of point to point use (2)

2. Better loss function

3. Fix ML model

by 6/5
1. Run on all 6 datasets
[DONE]

2. Visualize each dataset has 
> Two spreadsheets (whole visualization vs only distances) wtih 4 (5th column is average of 4) by 6 chart

3. Video 
> first two are ground truth
> third is from only distance prediction
> fourth is from whole visualization prediction
> add graph titles
> combine
[DONE]

4. Fix epsilon
[DONE]

[pick from 4 electrodes]

II.
1. Fix ML models

2. Clean + integrate code 

3. Run on add previous datasets



by 5/29 (Wednesday)
1. Add MSE for predictions based on only distances (for four points) and from visualization (from old code + extract) [even if not direct comparison]
    > Get 8 numbers
    > Have video integration

1. Fix slider indexing issue

changed to only show if point is actually closest to two adjacent points

2. Fix hand size error

fixed to avg of first 20 framess

fixed logic error where instead of comparing the 0 and 9 points it was comparing the 0th and 9th locations, which are the x of the 0th point and the x of the 3rd point

3. Adjusted visualization angles

changed to top right corner

4. Change distance epsilon

made smaller to match visualization + expected

5. Fix distance between index error

Instead of getting the ratio between two points, calculate the actual distance based on the info provided w the formula
(a^2 + b^2 - c^2)/2a where a is the distance between joints in the finger, b is the distance from the point given to the first joint, and c is the distance from the point to the second joint
